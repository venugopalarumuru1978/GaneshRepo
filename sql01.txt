Today's Agenda
--------------
Data		:- Collection of Raw facts and Figures
				
Process		:- The work which we do by using data

Information	:- The processed Data / The final result of the task

			Data  =>  Process =>  Information

Table :- The collection of fact and figures organised in a structral format. i.e. table format.
			Collection of rows and columns of particular entity. 

	Purpose :-  easy to access and easy to understand.

			Ex:-  any org  data can be represented in the form tables only. 

Database :- :- The collection of fact and figures organised in a structral format(tables) of an entity. 
					or
			Collection of Inter-related tables of an entity.

	Purpose :-  To overcome the drawbacks of file process system(FMS).

FMS drawbacks: -
		1.  No Security.
		2.  Limited Data Storage.
		3.  No Query Language provided to access any info quickly.

Database System :- 
		1.  Full Security. 
		2.  Unlimited Storage System.
		3.  Query Language(SQL)  to access and maintain databases.

Example of Database:- 
			School Database

	1. Students
		Biodata		:-   Sno, StdName, FatherName, gender, Age, Address, Location, Pincode, Phone, Rollno
		ClassInfo	:-   RollNo   Class 	Section
		ExamsInfo	:-   RollNo	Exam 	ExamDate
		MarksInfo	:-   RollNo	Exam	Sub1	Sub2	Total 	Percentage	Result
		AttendanceInfo
		Feesparticulars
		Transporatation
	2. Employees
		PersonalInfo
		JobDetails
		SalaryDetails
	3. Library
		BooksInfo
		MembersInfo
		IssuedBooks
		MaintainceInfo
				These 14 tables are called as School Database.
----------------------
Database Management System(DBMS) :- This will provide collection of rules to create and manage database systems.
	these rules are called as Codd rules, who has defined these rules M.F.Codd. 
	based on dbms, some software tools are introduced into market
		
		DBASE
		FoxProw
Later on that DBMS has got  different versions
		RDBMS -  Relational DBMS
		ORDBMS -  Object Relational DBMS
		MDBMS - Modern DBMS

Software Tools
		ORACLE		-  Oracle Corporation(SQL, SQL * Plus, Pl/SQL)
		SQL Server	-  Microsoft (SQL, T-SQL)
		MySQL		- 
		Postgre SQL	-
		DB2		-
		Sybase		-
----------------
What is a MySQL?
	It is one of the RDBMS related programmable package.

			It has two sections
				SQL	:-  Strctured Query Language
				T-SQL	:-  Transact - SQL(programming)

Package :-  It is a readymade tool to work with specific task. 
		MS _ Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)

Programming Language :-  these are used to develop softwares(applications).
			
Latest Version of MySQL is 9.4 version  and running version is 8.0. 
--------------------------------
What is an SQL?
		It is an Universal Language for Databases. Initally it was developed by ANSI Company, but they could not develop enviornment for the SQL, they used work on Command Prompt.  

It is a non-procedural language, due to this it provides collection of commands which are classified into different types. 

1.  Data Defintion Language(DDL) Commands :-  CREATE, ALTER, DROP
2.  Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands :-  INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3.  Data Retrival Language(DRL) Commands :-  SELECT
4.  Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands :-  COMMIT, ROLLBACK
5.  Data Control Language(DCL) Commands :-  GRANT, REVOKE

Database :-  It is a collection of different objects, An object is data item in database to perform specific task. 
			MySQL DB having following objects
				TABLE, VIEW, INDEX, STORED PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, TRIGGER, ....
				Note :-  all other objects are depends on Tables, because tables stores actual data. 

	CREATE DATABASE  <DB_NAME>;

	CREATE DATABASE  SEPTDB;

USE :- This command is used to change from one database to another database. 
		USE <DB_NAME>;

Table Creation :- 
		CREATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME>(
		COL_1_NAME  <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT], 
		COL-2-NAME  <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT],
		.................
		.................
		COL_N_NAME <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT]);


Data Types:-   Classification of data based on column specified in table. 
			Data classified into two type in general
				Numeric Data - Numbers(integer - whole numbers &  float  -  decimal numbers)
				Textual Data - Strings(Character -  Either Single digit/an alphabet/a symbol)
							String - Collection of characters
INT   -  integers (whole numbers)
FLOAT 	-  decimal numbers
CHAR	-  String with fixed length
VARCHAR -  String with variable length
DATE    -  Only Date Value (format: YYYY/MM/DD)
TIME	-  Only Time Value (format:  HH:MM:SS)
DATETIME - Both Date and Time
IMAGE    - for Binary Data


CREATE TABLE BIODATA(
ROLLNO  INT, 
STDNAME  VARCHAR(20), 
BIRTHDATE  DATE, 
LOCATION CHAR(10));
