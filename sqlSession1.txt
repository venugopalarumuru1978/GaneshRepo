---------------
Why should we learn a programming language?
	To develop softwares as per the client requirements. 

Why should we learn databases?
	To store data in a securied way. 
---------------
Data 		:- Collection of facts and figures / raw materials.
Process		:- The work which we do using data.
Information	:- The processed data. 

			Data ==> Process ==> Information
					or
			Input ==> Process ==>  Output

Table :- Collection of rows and columns is called a table.
		for easy navigate with	data  and easy to understand. 

	Every organisation uses data in the form of table format. 

To maintain table formated data there are some softwares tools exist,  MS-Excel, MS-Access, ...

Limitations of the file format:- 

1.  Limited Data Storage.
2.  No Security for the data.
3.  Accessing Information is manual process.

because of these reasons, organisations avoids working with file format to store their data. 
so that we got an alternative solution, working with databases. 

What is a Database? 
	Collection of raw material of an entity organised in a structural format(Table). 
				or
	Collection of inter-related tables of an entity. 

	Table		:-  Collection of rows and columns
	Row/Record	:-  Complete info about an entity
	Column/Attribute/Property :-  It specifies that one part of the Record. 

Features :- 
	To over come the limitations of File Process. 
		1. Unlimited Data Storage.
		2. Full Security, i.e. Only authorised people can access data.
		3. It will provide Query Language, using that lang, we can access data very easly. 

Example :- School Database
	Students
		Biodata		
		Examination
		Marks
		Fees
		Attendance
		Transporatation
	Employees
		Emp_Personal_info
		EmpJob Details
		Emp Salary Details
	Library
		Books
		Members
		Suppliers
		Issued_Books

here each type of info can be presented as a separate Table(Biodata, Examination, Marks, Fees, ....).

DBMS :- Database Management System
		It is a the process of providing set of rules to create and manage database systems. 
		These rules are called as Codd rules. because these are developed by M.F. Codd. 
		These are almost 14 rules.

		based DBMS, there are some new DBMS types exist
			RDBMS	:-  Relational DBMS
			ORDBMS	:-  Object Relational DBMS -- Object Oriented Programming Structure(OOPS)
			MDBMS	:-  Modern DBMS  -  Deals with Remote Databases. 


from these all dbms's, working enviornment going with RDBMS.


DBMS -  DBase, FoxProw, ....

Software Tools, MySQL(SQL, T-SQL), 
		Oracle(SQL, SQL*Plus, PL/SQL), 
		MS - SQL Server(SQL, T-SQL), 
		Postgre SQL(SQL, SQL*Plus, PL/SQL), .....
-----------------
What is a MySQL?
	It is one of the RDBMS related software tool.
			There are two sections
				1.  SQL 	:-   Structured Query Language
				2.  T-SQL 	:-   Transact SQL(Programming)
What is an SQL?
		It is an Universal Language for Databases. It is a Non-Procedural Language so that it consist 
		colllection of commands.

		SQL was developed by ANSI Company, but they could not able to develop enviornment for the SQL.
		they were working on SQL using Command Prompt.

SQL Commands are classified into 5 types

1.  Data Defintion Language(DDL) Commands :-   CREATE, ALTER, DROP
2.  Data Maninpulation Language(DML) Commands :- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
3.  Data  Retrival language(DRL) Command :- SELECT
4.  Transaction Control Language(TCL) Commands :-  ROLLBACK, COMMIT
5.  Data Control Language(DCL) Commands -  GRANT, REVOKE
-------------------------------
Operators :-  these are symbols / words used to perform some operations between operands.

As per MySQL, 

Arithematic operators :-  +, -, *, /, %
Relational operators :-  >, <, >=,<=, !=(not equals), =
Logical operators :-   AND, OR, NOT
SQL operators :-   BETWEEN, IN, IS, LIKE
----------------------------------------
SQL Commands :- 
Database :- It is a collection of Objects, An object is a data item in database, which tells that specific type of data. 
		Objects :-   TABLE, VIEW, INDEX, STORED PROCEDURE, FUNCTIONS, TRIGGERS,...

the following command is used to create a database

CREATE  DATABASE  <DATABASE_NAME>;

CREATE DATABASE WEEKENDDB;

USE :-  this command is used to switch between one database to another database. 

USE <DATABASE_NAME>;

USE WEEKENDDB;

How to create table:- 

CREATE TABLE <TABLE_NAME>(
COL-1 <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT], 
COL-2 <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT], 
------------
COL-N <DATA TYPE> [CONSTRAINT]);

Data Types:-  Classification of data based col specified while creating table. 

INT  -  whole numbers
FLOAT - decimal numbers
CHAR  -  Text(String) with fixed length
VARCHAR - Text(String) with VARIABLE length
DATE	- for date values - (YYYY-MM-DD)
TIME	- for time values
DATETIME - for both date and time
IMAGE    - for binary 
LOB/CLOB/BLOB for binary
--------------------------------
Difference b/w CHAR and VARCHAR

STDNAME  CHAR(20)	:- venugopal -  String Length is 20 chars
STDNAME  VARCHAR(20)	:- venugopal -  String Length is 9 chars
--------------------------------
Constraints :-  these are the rules to implements on table columns while creating table. 

NULL		:- it allows to have null values(empty values). it is default constraint
NOT NULL	:- it will not allow null values
UNIQUE		:- it will not allow duplicate values
PRIMARY KEY	:- combination of Not Null and Unique
CHECK		:- it checks range of values / specific values
DEFAULT		:- it allows set a default value for a column.
FORIGEN KEY	:- it allows create relationship b/w tables.
------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE STUDENT(
ROLLNO INT PRIMARY KEY,
STDNAME VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
GENDER  CHAR(1) CHECK(GENDER IN('M','F')), 
AGE  INT CHECK(AGE>=20 AND AGE<=30), 
LOCATION VARCHAR(20)  DEFAULT 'HYDERABAD');
